     It should perform any initialization needed before the scan can start,
     but not start executing the actual scan (that should be done upon the

     Fetch one row from the foreign source, returning it in a tuple table slot
     (the node's <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>ScanTupleSlot</TT
> should be used for this
     purpose).  Return NULL if no more rows are available.  The tuple table
     slot infrastructure allows either a physical or virtual tuple to be
     returned; in most cases the latter choice is preferable from a
     performance standpoint.  Note that this is called in a short-lived memory
     context that will be reset between invocations.  Create a memory context
     in <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>BeginForeignScan</CODE

     columns that are not needed, you should insert nulls in those column
     positions, or else generate a <TT

     whether the rows returned violate any constraints that were defined on
     the foreign table &mdash; but the planner does care, and may optimize
     queries incorrectly if there are rows visible in the foreign table that
     do not satisfy a declared constraint.  If a constraint is violated when
     the user has declared that the constraint should hold true, it may be
     appropriate to raise an error (just as you would need to do in the case
     of a data type mismatch).

     necessarily return exactly the same rows.

     Create possible access paths for a join of two (or more) foreign tables
     that all belong to the same foreign server.  This optional
     function is called during query planning.  As

     joining are always possible.

     relation, with different combinations of inner and outer relations; it is

    </P
><P
>     If a <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"

     represent the entire join process; paths generated for the component
     tables and subsidiary joins will not be used.  Subsequent processing of
     the join path proceeds much as it does for a path scanning a single
     foreign table.  One difference is that the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>scanrelid</TT
> of
     the resulting <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignScan</TT

     since there is no single relation that it represents; instead,
     the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fs_relids</TT
> field of the <TT
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>ForeignScan</TT
>
     node represents the set of relations that were joined.  (The latter field
     is set up automatically by the core planner code, and need not be filled
     by the FDW.)  Another difference is that, because the column list for a
     remote join cannot be found from the system catalogs, the FDW must
     fill <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"
>fdw_scan_tlist</TT
> with an appropriate list
     of <TT

     it will supply at run time in the tuples it returns.

RecheckForeignScan (ForeignScanState *node, TupleTableSlot *slot);</PRE
><P>
     Recheck that a previously-returned tuple still matches the relevant
     scan and join qualifiers, and possibly provide a modified version of
     the tuple.  For foreign data wrappers which do not perform join pushdown,
     it will typically be more convenient to set this to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>NULL</TT
> and
     instead set <TT
CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

     When outer joins are pushed down, however, it isn't sufficient to
     reapply the checks relevant to all the base tables to the result tuple,
     even if all needed attributes are present, because failure to match some
     qualifier might result in some attributes going to NULL, rather than in
     no tuple being returned.  <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>RecheckForeignScan</TT

     qualifiers and return true if they are still satisfied and false
     otherwise, but it can also store a replacement tuple into the supplied
     slot.
    </P
><P
>     To implement join pushdown, a foreign data wrapper will typically
     construct an alternative local join plan which is used only for
     rechecks; this will become the outer subplan of the
     <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>ForeignScan</TT
>.  When a recheck is required, this subplan
     can be executed and the resulting tuple can be stored in the slot.
     This plan need not be efficient since no base table will return more
     than one row; for example, it may implement all joins as nested loops.

     specified by <TT

CLASS="STRUCTFIELD"

     either, as the core server will automatically skip any returned commands
     for tables excluded according to those options.  However, it's often
     useful to avoid the work of creating commands for excluded tables in the
     first place.  The function <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>IsImportableForeignTable()</CODE
> may be
     useful to test whether a given foreign-table name will pass the filter.
